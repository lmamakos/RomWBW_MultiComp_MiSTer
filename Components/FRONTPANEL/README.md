# Front Panel Interface

> **Status:** Wired into the `MicrocomputerZ80CPM` core with a single
> 8-bit `Transparent_Capture_Chain` sourced from a R/W latch at I/O
> port 0x47, and the subsystem's 8-port control window occupies I/O
> ports 0xA0..0xA7. The WS2812 serial line emerges on `USER_OUT[6]` of
> the MiSTer USER_IO port. On initial hardware bring-up the output
> showed correct WS2812 bit timing/count but every bit was 0 (no LED
> lit). Two changes have since been made to isolate the cause:
>
> 1. **Capture-chain bit order fixed.** `Transparent_Capture_Chain` and
>    `Universal_Capture_Chain` previously shifted `combined_data` out
>    **LSB-first**; combined with `FrontPanel_Subsystem`'s left-shift
>    capture of the incoming serial stream, this bit-*reversed* an
>    8-bit source register relative to physical LED order. Both chain
> variants now shift **MSB-first**, so (with the default identity
> mapping -- see `FP_RAM_Store.vhd`) LED *i* mirrors bit *i* of an
> 8-bit source register directly — matching a natural left-to-right
> PCB layout — instead of the mirrored order.
> 2. **Colour path simplified for bring-up.** `FrontPanel_Subsystem`'s
>    per-LED fade ramp and on/off colour interpolation + brightness
>    scaling (the `alpha_ram`/`MATH_INIT`/`MATH_CHANNEL`/`MATH_BRIGHT`
>    machinery) have been removed for now. Each LED now shows its
>    RAM-stored "on" or "off" colour directly and instantly, selected by
>    the mapped chain bit (or framebuffer bit). This does not change the
>    I/O port map, and the mapping table (`+5`) and framebuffer
>    (`+4`/`+6`) are unchanged and fully functional; only the fade/
>    interpolation/brightness stage was removed. The global-brightness
>    (`+0`) and fade-rate (`+1`) registers are still stored and
>    readable/writable but currently have no effect — they're reserved
>    for reintroduction once basic LED output is confirmed on hardware.
>
> Several further bugs were found and fixed after that first bring-up pass:
>
> 3. **Z-80 I/O decoder no longer re-triggers on every `clk` edge.**
>    `clk` runs far faster than the Z-80's own (divided-down) clock, so
>    `io_cs`/`iorq_n`/`wr_n`/`rd_n` stayed asserted for several `clk`
>    edges per Z-80 bus cycle; the decoder's write/read side effects
>    were gated on those raw levels, so a single `OUT`/`IN` instruction
>    caused pointer auto-increment and colour-stream byte collection to
>    fire several times instead of once. Fixed with one-shot
>    edge-detected strobes (`wr_pulse` at the start of a write,
>    `rd_done_pulse` at the end of a read) gating the side effects,
>    while `dout` itself stays level-driven so it remains valid for
>    however long the CPU holds `RD` low.
> 4. **`FP_RAM_Store` colour/map RAM restored.** The Master Controller's
>    real colour/map RAM readback (`r_col_b`/`r_map_b`) had been
>    temporarily swapped for hardcoded test literals, which caused
>    Quartus's optimizer to eliminate `color_ram` from the build
>    entirely (confirmed absent from the fitter report) and to collapse
>    `map_ram`'s dead second read port. The real RAM-backed logic is
>    restored (the old hardcoded literals are left commented out for
>    easy A/B testing). A fresh Quartus build confirms `color_ram` is
>    now a real 64×48 M10K block.
> 5. **RAM contents now re-initialize on every reset, not just once at
>    power-up.** `color_ram`/`map_ram`/`fb_ram` previously relied solely
>    on a Quartus-only `ram_init_file` attribute (which a plain VHDL
>    simulator like GHDL never honours) or a VHDL default value (which
>    only applies once, at elaboration/power-up, not on a later reset
>    pulse). `FP_RAM_Store` now has its own small init sequencer that
>    steps through every address writing the default content (identity
>    map, a visible default on/off colour, framebuffer all off) for
>    `NUM_LEDS` `clk` cycles every time `reset` is asserted, and exposes
>    `init_done` so `FrontPanel_Subsystem`'s Master Controller can hold
>    off starting the first refresh until it's finished. `colors.mif`/
>    `mapping.mif` are no longer used (also removed; see point 6) --
>    the defaults now live solely in `FP_RAM_Store.vhd`.
> 6. **Colour interface changed from GRB to RGB, hidden GRB reorder.**
>    The `+3` colour-stream port and `color_ram`'s storage format used
>    to match the WS2812/SK6812 wire's native G,R,B byte order, forcing
>    software to think in GRB. Storage and the `+3` port are now plain
>    R,G,B (matching how every other colour API works); the GRB reorder
>    the LEDs actually need happens only in the new `SCALE_BRIGHT` state,
>    immediately before the PHY, so it's entirely invisible to software.
> 7. **Global brightness (`+0`) re-implemented.** Removed during the
>    initial bring-up simplification (point 2 above) along with the
>    fade ramp, brightness scaling is back as a single extra pipeline
>    state (`SCALE_BRIGHT`) that scales each of the selected colour's
>    three channels independently by `global_bright` using the standard
>    8-bit "scale8" convention (`scaled = (channel * global_bright) /
>    256`; matches e.g. FastLED's `scale8()`). `global_bright = 0xFF` is
>    ~full brightness, `0x00` forces the LED fully off. The fade-rate
>    (`+1`) register remains stored/readable but inert; gradual fade
>    *between* on and off is still future work.
> 8. **Two write-path correctness bugs found and fixed while adding the
>    above:**
>    - The `+3`/`+5`/`+6` pointer auto-increment updated `global_ptr` in
>      the *same* cycle as the write commit (`we_col`/`we_map`/`we_fb`),
>      but `FP_RAM_Store`'s actual RAM write only takes effect one
>      cross-entity `clk` edge later -- by which point `global_ptr` (and
>      hence `addr_a`) had already advanced, so every auto-incrementing
>      write silently landed one slot ahead of where it should have.
>      Fixed by deferring the pointer update by one extra cycle
>      (`pending_incr`) so `FP_RAM_Store` still sees the original
>      address at the moment it actually commits the write.
>    - `global_ptr` could be driven past `NUM_LEDS-1` (e.g. by streaming
>      exactly `NUM_LEDS` accesses through `+5`/`+6`), which is an
>      out-of-bounds array index for `color_ram`/`map_ram`/`fb_ram` --
>      undefined in synthesis and a hard simulation failure under GHDL.
>      The auto-increment now wraps at `NUM_LEDS` back to 0.
> 9. **Shift-in capture chain was one bit short at each end (fixed).**
>    Symptom on hardware: with a 64-bit chain (`fpChain` + 8 more bits of
>    static test data + `fpChainEnd`, the latter two copies both sourced
>    from the port `0xFF` `fpLatch` register), writing a value to
>    `fpLatch` put its MSB one LED late at the head of the chain, and its
>    LSB was entirely missing at the tail (with the tail group's MSB
>    also one LED late). Root cause: the Master Controller's `LATCH_ST`
>    state moved straight to `SHADOW_SHIFT` the same cycle `latch` was
>    presented to the capture chains, but a capture chain's parallel
>    load (`shift_reg <= captured_bits` on `latch = '1'`) — and likewise
>    its shift (`shift_reg <= ... & chain_in` on `shift_en = '1'`) — only
>    commits one `clk` edge later (`chain_out` is combinational off
>    `shift_reg`, but `shift_reg` itself is an ordinary registered
>    update). `SHADOW_SHIFT` started sampling `chain_in` one cycle too
>    early relative to both the load and, separately, the first shift,
>    so bit 0 was captured twice (once as stale/pre-load data, again as
>    a duplicate of the true bit 0) while the very last real bit was
>    never sampled at all — the same 64-cycle budget was spent on 63
>    real bits plus one wasted/duplicate cycle instead of 64 real bits.
>    Fixed with a new `LATCH_WAIT` settle state between `LATCH_ST` and
>    `SHADOW_SHIFT` (mirroring the existing `FETCH_MEM`/`WAIT_MEM`
>    cross-entity-latency idiom) that also raises `shift_en` a full
>    state ahead of `SHADOW_SHIFT`'s own first iteration, so both the
>    load and the first shift have already committed by the time
>    capturing begins. No change to the 64-cycle `SHADOW_SHIFT` loop
>    bound was needed.
>
> All four VHDL files (`FP_RAM_Store`, `Transparent_Capture_Chain`,

## Ultimate front panel light display

The premise for this is: if you have a CPU implemented in an FPGA,
then you have access to _all_ of the internal signals inside the CPU
that are normally inaccessible.  Given that, why not implement the
ultimate in blinkenlights front panel!

Sure, like an IMSAI you can show the data and address bus.  But
wouldn't it be interesting to see what the current value of the A
register is?  Why stop there; how about having **ALL** the registers
displayed, each with their own LEDs?  And likewise for control
signals, too.

The implementation approach is to use RGB addressable LEDs (like the
WS2812 devices) for the indicators.  In this way, only a single output
line from the FPGA is required to operate all of the LEDs.  There's
also the opportunity to use different colors, either for grouping
signals/registers, or to denote some alternate function (e.g.,
physical vs. mapped logical address.)

### Features

1. Each LED indicator should have a configurable and programmable ON
and OFF color (8 bits each, RGB).  The idea is that when the LED
changes state to OFF, it doesn't go completely dark, but is just
another (likely much dimmer) color.

2. The individual LED ON and OFF RGB values should be settable from the software
running on the Z-80 CPU by accessing some I/O ports.  

3. It should be possible to configure a gradual fade between the ON
and OFF transition as well as the OFF to ON transition.  This would be
used to simulate effecs such as the behavior of incandescent lamps.
   > *(Temporarily removed — see Status above. The instant on/off
   > switch is the current bring-up behavior; fade is to be
   > reintroduced once basic LED output is confirmed on hardware.)*

4. It should be possible to select some LEDs to capture brief ON
conditions and stretch them so the brief ON state is visible to the
naked eye.  This would be used to indicate certain signals that do not
occur frequently, such as interrupt requests or other signals.

5. Some of the LEDs are just connected to latched I/O port output
values.  This is similar to port 0xFF on IMSAI computers which allow
programs to set indications.  In this system, we'll have enough LEDs
to have more than one 8 bit "register" for this purpose.

6. The implementation should have a component that connects to the
signals we want to monitor and indicate on the LEDs.   One or more
of these would be chained together in a long shift-register.


## I/O register map

The `FrontPanel_Subsystem` exposes a window of 8 consecutive I/O ports.
The base address of that window is set entirely by the external I/O
decoder that drives the `io_cs` input; this module only looks at the
low 3 bits of `addr` to pick a register within the window. The
integrator should align the window on a multiple-of-8 boundary so the
three low address bits are a clean offset into the window.

| Offset | R/W | Function                                                       |
|--------|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| +0     | R/W | Global brightness (0..255, "scale8" style: 0xFF ~= full brightness, 0x00 = fully off). Applied to every channel of whichever colour is selected for display; see Status above. |
| +1     | R/W | Fade rate (step per refresh tick). Stored/readable but **currently has no effect** — the fade-ramp stage was removed for bring-up (see Status above). |
| +2     | R/W | Global pointer (LED index used by +3, +5, +6).                 |
| +3     | W   | Colour stream, R,G,B order (matches the LEDs' own on-wire GRB order internally, but never exposed to software -- see Status above). Six bytes per LED: on-R, on-G, on-B, off-R, off-G, off-B. On the sixth byte the global pointer advances by 1. |
| +4     | R/W | Mode register (bit 0: 0 = mirror capture chain, 1 = framebuffer). |
| +5     | R/W | Mapping-table entry at the global pointer. Both reads and writes auto-advance the pointer by 1. |
| +6     | R/W | Framebuffer bit at the global pointer. Both reads and writes auto-advance the pointer. |
| +7     | --  | Reserved (reads 0, writes ignored).                            |

The `+3`/`+5`/`+6` pointer auto-advance wraps at `NUM_LEDS` back to 0 rather than growing past it, so streaming exactly `NUM_LEDS` (or a multiple of it) accesses through any of those ports is always well-defined.

## Capture-chain variants

Two interoperable PISO capture components are provided. Both share the
same `chain_in` / `chain_out` / `latch` / `shift_en` handshake, so any
mix of them can be daisy-chained to form one logical chain.

**Bit order:** both variants capture `combined_data` and shift it out
**MSB-first** — bit `TOTAL_WIDTH-1` is captured/output first (right
after `latch`), counting down to bit `0` last. For a source register
this means its most-significant bit reaches the first LED position in
the chain, matching left-to-right order on a physical PCB layout
rather than a bit-reversed one.

- **`Universal_Capture_Chain`** — supports both transparent and
  stretched bits in a single instance. `STRETCH_MASK` is a per-bit
  mask: `'1'` enables stretching, `'0'` is transparent. A VHDL-2008
  `if-generate` emits a per-bit hold counter only for bits where
  `STRETCH_MASK(i) = '1'`, so resource cost scales with the number of
  stretched bits, not with `TOTAL_WIDTH`.

- **`Transparent_Capture_Chain`** — no stretching, no per-bit
  conditional logic, no counters. Recommended for the bulk of signals
  (address bus, data bus, register contents) that don't need
  stretching. Use `Universal_Capture_Chain` only for blocks that
  actually mix transparent and stretched bits.

## Example integration/usage

In this example we wire two capture chains in series: one transparent
chain for the address/data/status bus signals, and one universal chain
for the few control signals that need pulse stretching.

VHDL

    -- 24-bit transparent chain for bus signals
    --   [23..16] = Address bus high (Transparent)
    --   [15..8]  = Address bus low  (Transparent)
    --   [7..0]   = Data bus         (Transparent)
    U_BUS : entity work.Transparent_Capture_Chain
        generic map (
            TOTAL_WIDTH => 24
        )
        port map (
            clk           => sys_clk,
            reset         => sys_rst,
            latch         => fp_latch,
            shift_en      => fp_shift,
            combined_data => z_addr & z_dout,
            chain_in      => '0',
            chain_out     => bus_chain_to_ctrl
        );

    -- 8-bit mixed chain for control signals; bits 1 and 0 are stretched
    --   [7..2]   = Status flags (Transparent)
    --   [1]      = IACK         (Stretched)
    --   [0]      = INT          (Stretched)
    U_CTRL : entity work.Universal_Capture_Chain
        generic map (
            TOTAL_WIDTH  => 8,
            HOLD_CYCLES  => 2500000,
            STRETCH_MASK => "00000011" -- Only bits 0 and 1 are stretched
        )
        port map (
            clk           => sys_clk,
            reset         => sys_rst,
            latch         => fp_latch,
            shift_en      => fp_shift,
            combined_data => cpu_status,
            chain_in      => bus_chain_to_ctrl,
            chain_out     => serial_state
        );

Why this split is useful:

    Resource Efficiency: Transparent_Capture_Chain instantiates no
    counters at all, so the 24 bus signals cost only their shift-
    register flops. Universal_Capture_Chain's if-generate emits hold
    counters only for the two control bits that need stretching.

    Synchronous Capture: All capture and stretching happen on the same
    clock, so latch/shift handshake is consistent across chain
    segments.
    or jitter between external modules.

This gives you a powerful, software-like "Config" at the top of your
VHDL file that determines the visual behavior of every single bit on
your front panel.


## LED String Update Rate

1. The Protocol Bottleneck

The WS2812/SK6812 protocol uses a fixed timing where each bit takes
exactly 1.25µs to transmit.

    Bits per LED: Each RGB LED requires 24 bits (8 bits Red+8 bits
    Green+8 bits Blue).

    Total Bits: For 256 LEDs, you must transmit 256×24=6,144 bits.

    Transmission Time: 6,144 bits×1.25μs/bit=7.68ms.

    Reset Time: After the data, the line must stay low for a "Reset"
    period (typically >80μs for SK6812).

Total time to update the entire 256-LED string once is approximately
7.76ms.

2. Maximum Theoretical Frame Rate

If you were to push the string as fast as the physical wire allows:
Max Frequency=0.00776s1​≈128.8Hz

Conclusion: target 100 Hz update rate, derived from the 50 MHz system clock
