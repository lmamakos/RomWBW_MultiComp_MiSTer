-- =====================================================================
-- FrontPanel_Subsystem
--
-- Top level of the front-panel LED subsystem. Owns the Z-80 I/O port
-- decoder, the dual-port LED-state RAMs (colour, chain-bit mapping,
-- framebuffer), and the WS2812/SK6812 PHY that shifts the final pixel
-- data out on a single GPIO pin.
--
-- SIMPLIFIED FOR INITIAL BRING-UP: each LED shows its RAM-stored "on"
-- colour or "off" colour, scaled by the global brightness register,
-- selected by the mapped chain bit (or framebuffer bit) for that LED
-- -- an instant on/off switch, with no gradual fade *between* the two
-- colours (the fade-rate (+1) register is stored/readable for
-- software compatibility but has no effect; it is reserved for
-- reintroduction once basic output is confirmed on hardware). The
-- mapping table (+5) and framebuffer (+4/+6) are unchanged and fully
-- functional, and the global-brightness (+0) register is fully active
-- (see the SCALE_BRIGHT state below). See REQUIREMENTS.md / HISTORY.md
-- for context.
--
-- Clocking: a single clk (frequency = SYS_CLK Hz) clocks everything.
-- The PHY bit-time constants are derived from SYS_CLK so the WS2812
-- 1.25 us bit period is preserved regardless of clock frequency.
--
-- Colour storage/interface: colours are stored in FP_RAM_Store, and
-- streamed in/out over the +3 port, in plain R,G,B byte order. The
-- WS2812/SK6812 wire protocol actually wants G,R,B order; that
-- reorder happens only right before the PHY (see SCALE_BRIGHT below),
-- so software never has to deal with the LEDs' GRB quirk.
--
-- Reset behaviour: FP_RAM_Store re-initializes color_ram/map_ram/
-- fb_ram to known defaults (identity mapping, a visible default on/off
-- colour, framebuffer all off) every time reset is asserted, not just
-- once at FPGA power-up, so the front panel comes up in a reproducible
-- state after every Z-80 reset. This takes NUM_LEDS clk cycles; the
-- Master Controller (see IDLE state below) waits for it to finish
-- before starting the first refresh.
--
-- I/O register map (8 consecutive ports, aligned on a multiple-of-8
-- boundary, decoded relative to the io_cs chip-select input that the
-- external decoder drives):
--   +0   R/W  global brightness (0..255, 8-bit linear scale applied to
--              every channel of whichever colour -- on or off -- is
--              selected for display; see SCALE_BRIGHT below).
--   +1   R/W  fade rate -- stored, currently unused (reserved)
--   +2   R/W  global pointer (LED index for +3, +5, +6)
--   +3   W    colour stream: 6 bytes per LED (on-R, on-G, on-B,
--                    off-R, off-G, off-B); auto-advances pointer.
--   +4   R/W  mode register (bit 0: 0 = mirror chain, 1 = framebuffer)
--   +5   R/W  mapping table entry at global_ptr (read or write
--              auto-advances the pointer).
--   +6   R/W  framebuffer bit at global_ptr (read or write
--              auto-advances the pointer).
--   +7   --   reserved (reads 0, writes ignored)
--
-- The pointer auto-advance on +3/+5/+6 wraps at NUM_LEDS back to 0
-- (rather than growing past it), so streaming exactly NUM_LEDS (or an
-- exact multiple of NUM_LEDS) accesses through any of those ports is
-- always well-defined and lands back at LED 0.
--
-- This module looks only at the low 3 bits of addr to pick a register
-- within the 8-port window. The integrator decides where the window
-- lives in the Z-80 I/O space via io_cs (same pattern as the MMU's I/O
-- decoder).
