# quartus_build.sh — wrapper script to invoke Quartus compilation via SSH+Docker on tycho
#
# Usage:
#   tools/quartus_build.sh [quartus_sh options]
#   (or ./tools/quartus_build.sh if in the project root)
#
# Examples:
#   tools/quartus_build.sh --flow compile MultiComp -c MultiComp
#     (builds the entire project)
#
#   tools/quartus_build.sh --flow compile_synthesis MultiComp -c MultiComp
#     (runs only analysis & synthesis, skipping place & route)
#
#   tools/quartus_build.sh -t MultiComp
#     (queries current timing for the compiled design)
#
# Environment:
#   - Connects via SSH to the host 'tycho' (assumed to be in ~/.ssh/config or resolvable)
#   - Runs Docker container: ghcr.io/raetro/quartus:17.0
#   - Project root on tycho: Projects/z80fp/RomWBW_MultiComp_MiSTer
#   - Mounts current directory into /build inside the container
#
# Notes:
#   - This script can be run from the project root or from any subdirectory within it
#     (it will traverse up to find MultiComp.qpf and MultiComp.qsf).
#   - All output files are written back to the local project directory
#     after the container exits.
#   - This script requires SSH access to 'tycho' and Docker to be installed/configured there.
